# SJM-LongitudinalSurrogate

Semiparametric Joint Modeling (SJM): estimate the treatment effect on a longitudinal surrogate, the slope of the longitudinal outcome, by jointly modeling the longitudinal outcome and the informative terminal event, where the model for the longitudinal outcome is semiparametric, the relationship between the longitudinal outcome and the terminal event is nonparametric, and the terminal event is modeled via a semiparametric Cox model.
